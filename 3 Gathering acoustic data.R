# 3 Gathering acoustic files needed

#Natalie Nickells
#2nd January 2024

#Aim: to gather the acoustic files I will need to make my EV files together into one folder.
#These will be from the net times where krill were measured, from various cruises. 


#This script will be written in R Studio but version control will be used, 
#in GitHub repo Krill_Length_Frequency

#This script is an updated version/draws heavily on "Selecting_raw_files040823.R", 
#at filepath "D:\R code\Selecting_raw_files040823.R"


#Since acoustic files use a huge amount of storage, and each cruise has a large
#amount of acoustic data, I will gather together only the acoustic data around 
#the nets where krill have been measured.
